					Jim is the sole proprietor of Dullroar Enterprises.
					</p>
				<p>
					He currently lives in the mountains of northern New Mexico. When he isn't consulting or writing, he is usually out playing somewhere in the Rocky Mountains - hiking, climbing, backpacking, snowshoeing, and other things much more fun than dealing with data! He is also a twice-published O'Reilly author.
